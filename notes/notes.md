Notes from 2022-04
==================

* Look at hypothes.is notes to see what was skipped/changed
* Avoid using hidden files/directories. Better to teach `cp/scp/wget`
* Start scripting early on
* Consider teaching with `fastp` or `cutadapt` instead of `trimmomatic`
* Consider teaching with `snippy` or `breseq` instead of `bcftools
